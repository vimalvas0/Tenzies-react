# Tenzies Game ðŸŽ²

Welcome to the **Tenzies Game**! This is a fun, interactive dice game built with React. Roll the dice until all show the same number, and freeze dice as you go.

This project is my fourth in a series to facilitate my learning of React concepts, including state management, component structure, and more!

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. Roll the dice to generate random values.
2. Click each die to freeze it at its current value.
3. Continue rolling until all dice display the same number.

```bash
# Clone the repository
